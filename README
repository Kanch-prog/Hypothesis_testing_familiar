Familiar Blood Transfusion Analysis (Codeacademy Project)

Introduction
Welcome to Familiar, a startup in the blood transfusion market! As part of the data science team, your goal is to gain insights into subscribers’ lifespans and make data-driven decisions. In this project, we’ll focus on two subscription packages: the Vein Pack and the Artery Pack.

Tasks
1. Data Overview
We start by examining the dataset containing lifespans for subscribers to both packages. The data has been loaded into a dataframe named lifespans. Let’s take a look at the first five rows to understand the information.

2. Vein Pack Analysis
Extract the lifespans of subscribers to the ‘vein’ pack and save them as vein_pack_lifespans.
Calculate the average lifespan for Vein Pack subscribers using np.mean(). Is it longer than 73 years?
3. Hypothesis Testing
We want to determine if the average lifespan of a Vein Pack subscriber significantly differs from the average life expectancy of 73 years. Perform a hypothesis test with the following hypotheses:

Null hypothesis: The average lifespan of a Vein Pack subscriber is 73 years.
Alternative hypothesis: The average lifespan of a Vein Pack subscriber is NOT 73 years. Use a significance threshold of 0.05.
4. Artery Pack Comparison
Extract the lifespans of subscribers to the Artery Pack and save them as artery_pack_lifespans.
Calculate the average lifespan for Artery Pack subscribers. Is it longer than for the Vein Pack?
5. Hypothesis Testing (Vein vs. Artery)
We’ll compare the average lifespan of Vein Pack subscribers to that of Artery Pack subscribers:

Null hypothesis: The average lifespan of a Vein Pack subscriber is equal to the average lifespan of an Artery Pack subscriber.
Alternative hypothesis: The average lifespan of a Vein Pack subscriber is NOT equal to the average lifespan of an Artery Pack subscriber. Use a significance threshold of 0.05.
